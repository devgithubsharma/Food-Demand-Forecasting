# Food-Demand-Forecasting
In this project, we will analyse the demand of food by the customers in last 145 weeks by using different features provided in the data itself, and try to figure out that for which locations, category ,cuisine and price large number of orders has been placed.  After analysis ,predict the demand for meal in the next 10 upcoming weeks i.e,(146-155) for the center-meal combination.
